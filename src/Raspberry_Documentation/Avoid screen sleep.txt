
No matter what I do, I've relaized that when I type
$ cat /sys/module/kernel/parameters/consoleblank
to console I get
600

Which means that the screen will blank after 10 minutes.
To avoid this you have to enter:
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
and add 
$ consoleblank=0
right before 
$ rootwait
