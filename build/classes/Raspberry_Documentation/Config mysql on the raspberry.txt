

Install mysql-server:
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

To configure remote access to the server 'root' follow these steps:

$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
$ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
And then find the following line and comment it out in your my.cnf file, which usually lives on 
/etc/mysql/my.cnf 
on Unix/OSX systems. If it's a Windows system, you can find it in the MySQL 
installation directory, usually something like 
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\ and the filename will be my.ini.

Change line
 bind-address = 127.0.0.1
to
 #bind-address = 127.0.0.1
And restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect.

to restart server: 
$ /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
